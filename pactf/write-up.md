## Straight From The Emperor (10 points)
 - **Clue**: The Emperor says `ny_nx_tsq3_zumnqq_kwtr_mjwj_6a6b59e767`–what could it possibly mean? I hear that he ‘encrypts’ numbers now too, something about appending them to the alphabet…

 - **Hint**:
Some say he’s an emperor, I say he’s a salad.

## Caesar Cipher? (20 points)
 - **Clue**: “Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant only taste of death but once.” (1007, 1008) Are you valiant enough to figure this out?

 - **Hint**: There’s a lot of text on the Internet and in print. What if you could send messages using all of that data? But you’d have to pick something pretty famous…

## Bad Melody (30 points)

    Here’s the leak: [cc_leak.txt.bz2](Credit-Card-Leak/cc_leak.txt.eecc6f896436)

 - **Hint**: The credit card numbers in the leak are obviously all invalid, but most would pass a certain credit card validity test. All credit card numbers except one, that is.

## Getting to Know GDB (50 points)
 - **Clue**: A friend sent me a [mysterious binary](/Getting-to-Know-GDB/mysterious_elf771c3c9447cd). It’s supposed to print out the flag, but it’s giving me a weird poem and some hex instead.

 - **Hint**: The flag is *in there somewhere*, but something gives me the feeling that searching the binary for strings wont help…

## Security Through Obscurity? (50 points)
 - **Clue**: We intercepted this message, but we can’t make heads or tails of it. It was rattled off so fast, too… How could anyone be that good at using a cipher?

    Anyway, here’s the message. Good luck!

    `Tązhii, Łį́į́ʼ, Dzeeh Mąʼii, Dibé yázhí, Wóláchííʼ, Tłʼízí Tin, Dibé Mósí, Łį́į́ʼ, Dzeeh, Dibé, Tązhii, Dzeeh, Gah, Neeshchʼííʼ, Dzeeh, Béésh dootłʼizh`

##The Lottery, Part Two: Untwisting Fate! (90 points)
 - **Clue**: This time the lottery is harder than ever! Can you manage to untwist the cockles of fate itself? Can you see into the future?

    [They seem to have given me a lot more information. Perhaps it’ll help?](Lottery-1/output.9327e404be0e)

 - **Hint**: We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes. — Pierre Simon Laplace, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities

##Siblings (120 points)
 - **Clue**: One 4096-bit RSA key is impossible to break, so 20 must be even better! By chaining each encryption together, surely it’s impossible for you to figure out what the message is?

    [Everything you’ll need (except the private keys, you’re on your own for that!)](Siblings/problem-data.e34ba61084c2.zip)

 - **Hint**: Numbers don’t have siblings, right? What could that mean?
